In cryptography, SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a cryptographic hash function designed by the United States
 National Security Agency and is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard published by the United States NIST.
  SHA-1 produces a 160-bit (20-byte)
 hash value known as a message digest. A SHA-1 hash value is typically rendered as a hexadecimal number, 40 digits long.
